# Prompt Rules

- Only do exactly what is asked in the prompt
- Do not add extra features, suggestions, or improvements unless explicitly requested
- Do not add comments or explanations in code unless asked
- Keep responses minimal and focused on the specific task
- Do not refactor or optimize code unless specifically asked to do so
